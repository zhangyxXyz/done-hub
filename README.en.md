- Supports configuring **unified request-response model names**
- Supports **removing specified parameters** from channel extra parameters
- Supports **model variable substitution** in channel `BaseURL`
- Supports **pass-through of extra parameters** for native `/gemini` image generation requests
- Supports **pass-through of extra parameters** for `Claude` channels (both OpenAI format and native format)
- Supports **custom channels** using native `Claude` routing - integrating `ClaudeCode`
- Supports `VertexAI` channels using native `Gemini` routing - integrating `GeminiCli`
- Supports `VertexAI` channels using native `Claude` routing - integrating `ClaudeCode`

- Supports native **video generation requests** (`Veo` series models) for `Google Gemini` channels via `/gemini`
- Supports `gemini-2.0-flash-preview-image-generation` for text-to-image/image-to-image, compatible with `OpenAI` chat interfaces
- Added **invitation code settings** module
- Added **user group functionality for batch channel addition**

- Fixed several `bugs` where user quota cache inconsistencies with `DB` data caused billing anomalies
- Removed meaningless original price-related styles from log functionality
- Optimized email rule validation
- Optimized several `UI` interactions
- Optimized logic for disabled channel email notifications
- Optimized `VertexAI` authentication caching
- ...

## Deployment

> Follow the original deployment tutorial and replace the image with `ghcr.io/zhangyxx/done-hub`.
